# Fashion-MNIST
What is Fashion MNIST?
Fashion MNIST is a dataset of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each showing a grayscale image of a clothing item (like T-shirt, shoe, bag, etc.).

It was created by Zalando, an online fashion retailer, and released as a better alternative to the original MNIST handwritten digit dataset.

ðŸŽ¯ Why Fashion MNIST?
The original MNIST (digits 0â€“9) is too easy for modern ML models.

Fashion MNIST is more challenging, realistic, and good for benchmarking image classification models.

Still has the same format (size, structure) as MNIST â€” so you can easily swap it in your code.
